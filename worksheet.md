1. Test your palindrome program on the following inputs and note
the results.

a) abba
   is a palindrome
b) aaba
   is NOT a palindrome
c) foobar
   is not a palindrome
d) civic
   is a palindrome
e) civil
   is not a palindrome
f) foo
   is not a palindrome

2. Fill out the following table with the specified values using the `recursiveFunction` program.

n     f(n)     Time (sec) \\
0     2        0
1     2        0
2     3        0
5     7        0
10    30       0
20    675      0
30    15260    0
40    345241   2
42    644228   4
44    1202146  11
46    2243235  28
48    4185933  73


3. Without actually running it, predict on how long it
   would take to run the program for n = 50.  How long would it
   run for n = 100?
   2 minutes for n = 50
   20 minutes for n = 100

4. What values do you get for each of the following inputs with
   your Jacobsthal program?

a) n = 0:  0
b) n = 1:  1
b) n = 5:  11
b) n = 10: 341
b) n = 20: 349525
b) n = 32: 1431655765
